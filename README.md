# üîí Encryption and Decryption Web Application

## üìù Project Overview
This web application provides a robust platform for **encrypting and decrypting text and files** using various cryptographic algorithms. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and security of data. Additionally, the application includes simulations of **passive attacks**, helping users understand potential vulnerabilities and strengthen their security measures.

## üöÄ Features
- **Text and File Encryption/Decryption:** Securely encrypt and decrypt both text data and files.
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms:**
  - AES
  - DES
  - Triple DES
  - Blowfish
  - RC4
  - Caesar Cipher
  - Railfence Columnar Transposition
- **Passive Attack Simulation:** Simulate and analyze the impact of passive attacks on encrypted data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive web interface for easy interaction.
- **Detailed Logs:** Comprehensive logging of encryption, decryption, and attack simulations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Flask (or Django if applicable)
- **Encryption Algorithms:** AES, DES, Triple DES, Blowfish, RC4, Caesar Cipher, Railfence Columnar Transposition
- **Database:** SQLite / MySQL (specify if used)
- **Version Control:** Git
